# Machine learning toolkit

This package is a personal project aimed for research purpose. It covers machine learning models implementation and 
processing functions. These models are implemented and deployed mainly using Google technologies as Tensorflow and
Google Cloud Platform utilities.

Python 2.7 has been chosen to ensure components compatibility. The project is structured using Distutils as a build 
automation tool. Test are implemented for each module using unittest.
